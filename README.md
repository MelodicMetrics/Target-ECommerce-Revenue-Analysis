# Target-ECommerce-Revenue-Analysis
A repository that contains documentation of my various analysis steps for this portfolio project.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: The goal of this project is to explore Revenue trends in E-commerce sales data from Target in Brazil.
- **Guiding Questions**: There are three questions guiding my analysis
  - **1.** Which product categories contribute the most to overall revenue, and how does profitability vary across categories?
  - **2.** How does the average order value and profitability vary by product category, seller, and region over time?
  - **3.** Is there a correlation between geographical location and average sales revenue?

    - **customer_id**: ID of the consumer who made the purchase
