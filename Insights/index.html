  <h1>Insights from Revenue Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
  <p

    guiding questions. Insights from my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helped
    inform insights from my Revenue Analysis (RA) for each question.</p

    <h2>Yearly Analysis Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The yearly analysis provided a foundational understanding of the dataset
      and informed decisions across all guiding questions. While 2016 had
      minimal data and was excluded from Revenue Analysis (RA), it was included
      in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase to offer a more holistic
      perspective.

    <h3>Key EDA Insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li
        ><strong>2016 Contribution:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li
            >Represented less than 5% of the total orders and revenue,
            significantly underperforming compared to 2017-2018.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Excluding 2016 ensured focus on
            trends that better represent customer behavior and revenue
            generation.</li

          <li
            >Total revenue increased by <strong>25%</strong> between 2017 and
            2018, with order volumes growing in tandem.</li

            period.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>State contributions:</strong> States like
            <strong>São Paulo</strong> and
            <strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong> dominated revenue generation,
            contributing over <strong>50%</strong> of total revenue.</li

    <h3>EDA Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <li

        <ul>
          <li>Analyzed total revenue and order counts by product category.</li>
          <li>
            Drill-through views explored revenue contribution per
            <strong>product value bin</strong>, defined by the combined
            <strong>price + freight value</strong> of products.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Products in the
            <strong>$700+</strong> bin contributed
            <strong>15% of revenue</strong> despite making up just
            <strong>1.8% of products</strong>.
          </li>
          <li
            >Products in the <strong>$100–$250</strong> range dominated,

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This insights page consolidates findings from both Exploratory Data
      Analysis (EDA) and Revenue Analysis (RA) phases, providing a comprehensive
      understanding of product categories, seller performance, and regional
      trends. By integrating insights from the EDA, the RA findings were able to
      build on data-driven foundations, ensuring a robust and actionable
      analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key findings emphasize the importance of focusing on categories with high
      Revenue Efficiency (RE), such as <strong>Gift Watches</strong> and
      <strong>Office Furniture</strong>, which also exhibited high Average Order
      Value (AOV) and strong multi-item order potential. Categories like
      <strong>Health & Beauty</strong>, while leading in total revenue, present
      opportunities to enhance efficiency through bundling strategies and
      targeted seller recruitment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regional insights highlighted <strong>São Paulo</strong> as the dominant
      revenue contributor, driving multi-item order trends in high Relative
      Difference % categories like <strong>Office Furniture</strong> and
      <strong>Signaling & Safety Products</strong>. Emerging markets such as
      <strong>Piauí</strong> demonstrated strong YoY revenue growth, revealing
      potential for targeted expansion strategies.
    </p>
    <p> These findings inform key actionable strategies: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Targeting high-performing categories for seller acquisition, product
        expansion, and improved bundling opportunities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimizing seller networks in key regions such as São Paulo and Rio de
        Janeiro to leverage their strengths.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investing in emerging markets like Piauí to capitalize on growth
        potential and diversify revenue streams.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leveraging insights from multi-item order trends to enhance
        profitability across top-performing states and categories.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By applying these strategies, the insights gained from this analysis can
      support data-driven decision-making to optimize performance across product
      categories, sellers, and regions.
