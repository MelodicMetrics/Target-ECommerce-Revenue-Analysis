I"<h1>Revenue Distribution Dashboard: Product Value Bins Analysis</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
  This dashboard analyzes the distribution of <strong>product revenue by value bins</strong>, focusing on understanding 
  how different product price ranges contribute to overall revenue and order count. It aims to provide insights into the 
  disproportionate impact of high-value products and uncover the revenue patterns across different product categories. 
  This analysis is critical for identifying high-value categories and prioritizing strategies for revenue optimization.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Segmentation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Orders were grouped into five value bins based on their total value (<code>price + freight_value</code>): <code>$7.28–$100</code>, <code>$100–$250</code>, <code>$250–$500</code>, <code>$500–$700</code>, and <code>$700+</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Revenue and Order Count Calculation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Each bin's revenue contribution and order count percentage were calculated relative to the total dataset.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Drillthrough Analysis:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Product categories were analyzed within each value bin to uncover:
        <ul>
          <li>Total revenue per category.</li>
          <li>Order count and frequency.</li>
          <li>Average revenue per order.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The focus was on identifying categories with the highest average revenue or disproportionate contributions to specific bins.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Comparative Metrics:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Key metrics such as <strong>total revenue</strong>, <strong>average revenue per order</strong>, and <strong>percentage contributions</strong> were evaluated to highlight patterns and outliers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Dashboard Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Main View (All Value Bins):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A combination of <strong>bar and line charts</strong> is used to compare the <strong>percentage of products per value range</strong> (bar) against the <strong>percentage of revenue</strong> (line). This highlights discrepancies between the number of orders and the revenue they contribute, making it easy to identify disproportionate impacts of high-value ranges.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Breakaway Visual (700+ Value Bin):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>stacked bar chart</strong> is used to display the <strong>percentage of revenue contribution by category</strong> within the <code>$700+</code> bin. This allows a detailed breakdown of how specific categories like <em>Gift Watches</em> and <em>Personal Computers</em> contribute to the total revenue in this high-value range.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interactive Filters:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Users can filter data by year (2016–2018) and specific value bins to explore trends over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Detailed Tables:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Breakdowns of revenue and order counts by product category and value bin.</li>
      <li>Individual product details for each bin range, including total revenue and frequency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
