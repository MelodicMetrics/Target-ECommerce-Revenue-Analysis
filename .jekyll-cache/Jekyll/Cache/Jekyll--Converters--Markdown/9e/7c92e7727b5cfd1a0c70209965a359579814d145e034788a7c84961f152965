<p>In the initial phase of data cleaning, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer_id</code>s were filtered down to include only those appearing in the four most populated states in Brazil. With additional data from the IBGE, I was able to bring in many more valid entries. Previously, there were <strong>20,958</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer_id</code>s; after making various adjustments, this number increased to <strong>93,927</strong>â€”a gain of <strong>72,969</strong>. This is out of <strong>99,441</strong> total customers in the original dataset. The changes I implemented ensured that <em>94.45%</em> of the customers table was usable for analysis, compared to the initial <em>21.08%</em>.</p>

<p>During the creation of this table, I found that the number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer_id</code>s varied based on whether <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Geolocation_Final</code> was created using an INNER or RIGHT JOIN with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code>. This led to a deeper investigation, where I discovered discrepancies between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Customers</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Geolocation</code>: six <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer_city</code> entries did not appear in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Geolocation</code> (or in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Geolocation_Unaccented</code>). By creating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Geolocation_Final</code> with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RIGHT JOIN</code> to include all entries from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code>, I was able to bring back those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer_id</code>s, resulting in the aforementioned total of <strong>93,927</strong>.</p>
