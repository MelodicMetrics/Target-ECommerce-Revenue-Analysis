<p>In my initial analysis, I considered using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sellers_Final</code> table on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seller_id</code>. However, since I was no longer filtering <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sellers_Final</code> by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code>, this approach would have introduced all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order_ids</code> linked to those unfiltered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seller_ids</code> â€” regardless of whether the orders were made by customers from valid city-state combinations.</p>

<p>Instead, I opted to use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Orders_Final</code>, which ensured that only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order_ids</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seller_ids</code> associated with filtered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer_ids</code> appeared in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Order_Items_Final</code> table. An additional benefit of this approach was that I no longer needed to include filter logic for either missing or discrepant <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order_ids</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recalculated Missing Orders</strong>:<br />
These <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order_ids</code> were inherently excluded, as they were already absent from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Order Items</code> table in the initial dataset.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recalculated Discrepant Orders</strong>:<br />
These <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order_ids</code> were automatically excluded, as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Order_Items_Final</code> was created by joining on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order_id</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Orders_Final</code>, which had already filtered out discrepant orders.</p>
