I"t<h2> Customer Changes Overview </h2>

<p>
  In the initial phase of data cleaning, <code> customer_id </code>s were filtered down to include only those appearing in the four most populated states in Brazil. With additional data from the IBGE, I was able to bring in many more valid entries. Previously, there were <strong> 20,958 </strong> <code> customer_id </code>s; after making various adjustments, this number increased to <strong> 93,927 </strong>â€”a gain of <strong> 72,969 </strong>. This is out of <strong> 99,441 </strong> total customers in the original dataset. The changes I implemented ensured that <em> 94.45% </em> of the customers table was usable for analysis, compared to the initial <em> 21.08% </em>.

  During the creation of this table, I found that the number of <code> customer_id </code>s varied based on whether <code> Geolocation_Final </code> was created using an INNER or RIGHT JOIN with <code> IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth </code>. This led to a deeper investigation, where I discovered discrepancies between <code> Customers </code> and <code> Geolocation </code>: six <code> customer_city </code> entries did not appear in <code> Geolocation </code> (or in <code> Geolocation_Unaccented </code>). By creating <code> Geolocation_Final </code> with a <code> RIGHT JOIN </code> to include all entries from <code> IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth </code>, I was able to bring back those <code> customer_id </code>s, resulting in the aforementioned total of <strong> 93,927 </strong>.
