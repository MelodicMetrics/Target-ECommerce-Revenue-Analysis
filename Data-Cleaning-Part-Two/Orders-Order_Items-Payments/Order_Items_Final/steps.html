<h1>Steps to Create <code>Order_Items_Final</code></h1>

<hr />

<p>
  To ensure that only <code>seller_ids</code> attached to verified customer
  orders appeared in <code>Order_Items_Final</code>, I used a
  <code>JOIN</code> with <code>Orders_Final</code> rather than
  <code>Sellers_Final</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond this, there werenâ€™t many additional steps required. All filter logic
  applied to <code>Orders_Final</code> was automatically inherited by
  <code>Order_Items_Final</code>, since it was created using a
  <code>JOIN</code> with <code>Orders_Final</code>.

  /*
    This query creates the Order_Items_Final table with the following considerations:
    
    1. There was no need to include additional filter logic for either missing or discrepant `order_ids`:
       - Missing `order_ids` were inherently excluded, as they were already absent from the Order_Items table.
       - Discrepant `order_ids` were also excluded automatically, since this table is created by joining on `order_id` 
         from Orders_Final, which has already filtered out discrepant orders.
    
    2. Initially, I considered joining this table with the Sellers_Final table. However, doing so 
       would have introduced `order_ids` linked to sellers, regardless of whether the orders were made 
       by customers from valid city-state combinations.

       By joining on `order_id` instead, I ensured that only orders made by filtered customers were included.
       While this approach may still include `seller_ids` from unverified city-state combinations, this is
       acceptable as the analysis does not focus on seller locations.
