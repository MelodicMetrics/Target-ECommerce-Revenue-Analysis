<h1>Geolocation_Final Table Creation Steps</h1>

<h2>Part 1. Dataset Download</h2>

<hr class="title" />

<ul>
  <li>
    After downloading the dataset from the IBGE, I translated each column title
    to English in order to determine which columns were most likely to contain
    the information I was looking for <em>(cities and states)</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    After determining which columns I needed (Name of Municipality for Cities
    and Name of Federative Unit for States), I copied them into a new sheet and
    created a table (<code>City_State_Cleaning</code>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 2. Dataset Cleaning</h2>

<hr class="title" />

<h4
  >Step 1. Convert <code>Name of the Federative Unit</code> to
  <code>State Code</code></h4
>

<p>
  As the original dataset used State Codes rather than the actual State
  (Federative Unit) names, I had to convert the names into State Codes. In order
  to do this, I created a separate sheet with every State name and their
  respective State Code.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In my (<code>City_State_Cleaning</code>) table, I added a column entitled
    <strong>"StateCode"</strong> and used the following function to find the
    proper State Code for each State:
  </li>
</ul>

<details class="code-details">
  <summary
    >üìÇ<b
      ><i>Formula to find matching State Code for each Federative Unit</i></b
    ></summary
  >

  <pre><code class="language-plaintext">
   =XLOOKUP([@[Name of the Federative Unit]], StateCodes!A:A, StateCodes!B:B, "Not Found")
  </code></pre>

  Where:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>Name of the Federative Unit</code> refers to the column containing
      each state name.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>StateCodes!</code> tells the XLOOKUP function to specifically look
      at columns in a different sheet entitled "StateCodes".
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<hr />

<h4>Step 2: Convert City Names to Lowercase</h4>

<p>
  Next I needed to ensure that each city name was in lowercase to standardize
  with the original dataset.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I created a column entitled <strong>"Lowercase City"</strong> and used the
    following function to make every city name lowercase:
  </li>
</ul>

<details class="code-details">
  <summary
    >üìÇ<b><i>Formula to Convert Every City Name to Lowercase</i></b></summary
  >

  <pre><code class="language-plaintext">
   =LOWER([@[Name of Municipality(City)]])
  </code></pre>

  Where:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>LOWER</code> is the function name that will return whatever value
      selected in lowercase.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Name of Municipality(City)</code> refers to the column containing
      the city names.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<hr />

<h4>Step 3: Remove Accents from City Names</h4>

<p>
  My final step was to make sure that all of the cities did not contain accents
  due to most entries in the original dataset also not containing them.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I first copied all the cells in my <strong>"Lowercase City"</strong> column
    into another column entitled <strong>"Unaccented City"</strong>. Then I
    pulled that column into Power Query.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once in Power Query I added the following step in advanced edit so that the
    M code looked like the following:
  </li>
</ul>

<details class="code-details">
  <summary
    >üìÇ<b><i>M Code to remove Accents from City Names</i></b></summary
  >

  {% raw %}

  <pre><code class="language-dax">
  /*
    This long line of code basically just replaces all accents with their unaccented counterparts one by one
    while also ensuring any uppercase variants become lowercase as well.
  */

  let
    #"Remove Accents" = Table.TransformColumns(
    #"Changed Type",
      {{"Unaccented City", each 
         Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(
         Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(
         Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(
         Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(
         Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Lower(_), "√°", "a"), "√†", "a"), 
         "√¢", "a"), "√§", "a"), "√£", "a"), "√•", "a"), 
         "√©", "e"), "√®", "e"), "√™", "e"), "√´", "e"),
         "√≠", "i"), "√¨", "i"), "√Æ", "i"), "√Ø", "i"), 
         "√≥", "o"), "√≤", "o"), "√¥", "o"), "√∂", "o"), "√µ", "o"), 
         "√∫", "u"), "√π", "u"), "√ª", "u"), "√º", "u"), 
         "√±", "n"), "√ß", "c")}}
    )
   in
    #"Remove Accents"
  </code></pre>

  {% endraw %}
</details>

<hr />

<h4>Step 4: Remove Duplicate Cities</h4>

<p>
  After cleaning the city names and converting the states into State Codes, I
  needed to account for any potential duplicated cities. The original dataset
  was more granular and included detailed districts and administrative divisions
  per city. I was able to accomplish this task by highlighting my list of cities
  and using the <code>Remove Duplicates</code> function in Excel.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    This gave me a cleaned table and so I copied the "StateCode" and "Unaccented
    City" columns to a final sheet entitled <em>"IBGE Brazil City States"</em>.
    This table I saved as a .csv <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code>,
    which I imported into Google BigQuery under the same name.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 3. Geolocation_Final Creation</h2>

<hr class="title" />

<h4>Objective:</h4>

<p>
  After creating the table in BigQuery, I needed to filter the
  <code>Geolocation</code> table to only display cities and states that were
  marked as valid by my <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code> table. In
  order to do so, I needed to complete the following steps.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I needed to make sure that none of the cities in the original
    <code>Geolocation</code> table contained accents due to data entry errors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Join that unaccented <code>Geolocation</code> table with
    <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

    >üîç <b><i>Expand to view the steps in creating Geolocation_Final</i></b>
  </summary>

  <h3>Step 1: Creating <code>Geolocation_Unaccented</code></h3>

  <p>
    - I wrote the following query in order to create a new table of geolocations
    that ensured all cities were unaccented:
  </p>

  <details class="code-details">
    <summary
      >üìÇ<b
        ><i>Query to remove all accents from original Geolocation table</i></b
      ></summary
    >

    <pre><code class="language-sql">
   /*

    LOWER(...) converts all the city names to lowercase for consistent comparison. REGEXP_REPLACE(...) replaces all the accented characters with their unaccented versions.
    The original geolocation_city column is retained as well for reference.
    */
     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Unaccented` AS
    SELECT
    geolocation_state,

  <h3>Step 2: Creating <code>Geolocation_Final</code> with a RIGHT JOIN</h3>

  <p>
    - Once <code>Geolocation_Unaccented</code> was created, I proceeded to
    create the <code>Geolocation_Final</code> table using a
    <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> to ensure all city-state combinations from
    <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code> were included, even if they did
    not have a match in <code>Geolocation_Unaccented</code>.

  <h3>3A. Why RIGHT JOIN?</h3>

  <p>
    I noticed that when using an <code>INNER JOIN</code> to create the final
    table and selecting <code>DISTINCT</code> cities that were unaccented, I
    would get fewer <code>customer_ids</code> than if I used a
    <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> from the
    <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code> table. Specifically, it reduced
    from <strong>(98,715)</strong> to <strong>(98,709)</strong>, a loss of
    <strong>6</strong> IDs.
  </p>

  <h4
    >1. Using <code>Geolocation_Comparison</code> to Identify Missing
    Matches</h4
  >

  <p>
    To identify the cause of these removed IDs, I created a
    <code>Geolocation_Comparison</code> table using a
    <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> and retained accents to control for any potential
    changes introduced by removing them. The purpose of the
    <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> was to ensure that all city-state combinations from
    the source of truth table would appear, regardless of whether there was a
    matching entry in the Geolocation table.
  </p>

  <details class="code-details">
    <summary
      >üìÇ<b><i>Query to Create Geolocation_Comparison</i></b></summary
    >

    <pre><code class="language-sql">
      CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Comparison AS
      SELECT DISTINCT
        truth.City AS City,
        truth.StateCode AS Statecode
      FROM
        `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation` AS geo
      RIGHT JOIN
        `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` AS truth
      ON
        geo.geolocation_city = truth.city AND geo.geolocation_state = truth.StateCode;
    </code></pre>
  </details>

  <h4>2. Direct Comparison with <code>Geolocation_Final</code></h4>

  <p>
    This table (<code>Geolocation_Comparison</code>) was used to directly
    compare with a filtered version, specifically
    <code>Geolocation_Final_Original</code>. The <code>INNER JOIN</code> in
    <code>Geolocations_Final</code> pulls only cities and states that have a
    match between the two tables. Additionally, accents were not removed to
    confirm that any discrepancies were due solely to the difference between an
    <code>INNER JOIN</code> and a <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>, rather than any
    potential issues introduced by <code>Geolocation_Unaccented</code>.
  </p>

  <details class="code-details">
    <summary
      >üìÇ<b><i>Query to Create Geolocation_Final_Original</i></b></summary
    >

    <pre><code class="language-sql">
       CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Final_Original AS

       ON
         geo.geolocation_city = truth.city AND geo.geolocation_state = truth.StateCode;
    </code></pre>
  </details>

  <p>
    With these two versions of Geolocation tables, I could compare my customer
    tables to investigate why <code>INNER JOIN</code> was leading to fewer IDs.

    </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>
      &bull; After running my comparison, I discovered that six cities in
      <code>Customer</code> were either misspelled or missing entirely from
      <code>Geolocation</code>. Using an <code>INNER JOIN</code> would only
      include cities present in both <code>Geolocation</code> and
      <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code>. Therefore, to ensure these
      six cities were included, a <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> on
      <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code> was the best choice, as it
      retains all entries from that table, regardless of their presence in
      <code>Geolocation</code>.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h3>3B. Why COALESCE?</h3>

  <p>
    The purpose of the <code>COALESCE</code> function is to select values from
    <code>Geolocation_Unaccented</code> when present, or to default to values
    from <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code> when they are missing.
    This approach handles cases like <code>"Sambaiba, MA"</code> by filling gaps
    in <code>Geolocation_Unaccented</code> with the authoritative data from the
    IBGE table.
