# Geolocation_Final Table Creation Steps

## Part 1. Dataset Download

 - After downloading the dataset from the IBGE, I translated each column title to English in order to determine which columns were most likely to contain the information I was looking for *(cities and states)*.
 - After determining which columns I needed (Name of Municipality for Cities and Name of Federative Unit for States), I copied them into a new sheet and created a table (`City_State_Cleaning`).

## Part 2. Dataset Cleaning
### Step 1. Convert `Name of the Federative Unit` to `State Code`
As the original dataset used State Codes rather than the actual State (Federative Unit) names, I had to convert the names into State Codes. In order to do this, I created a separate sheet with every State name and their respective State Code.
  - In my (`City_State_Cleaning`) table, I added a column entitled **"StateCode"** and used the following function to find the proper State Code for each State:

<details>
 <summary>üìÇ<b><i>Function to find matching State Code for each Federative Unit</i></b></summary>

 ```excel
 =XLOOKUP([@[Name of the Federative Unit]], StateCodes!A:A, StateCodes!B:B, "Not Found")
 ```    
Where:
- `Name of the Federative Unit` refers to the column containing each state name.
- `StateCodes!` tells the XLOOKUP function to specifically look at columns in a different sheet entitled "StateCodes".
</details>

---

### Step 2: Convert City Names to Lowercase
Next I needed to ensure that each city name was in lowercase to standardize with the original dataset.
  - I created a column entitled **"Lowercase City"** and used the following function to make every city name lowercase:

<details>
 <summary>üìÇ<b><i>Function to Convert Every City Name to Lowecase</i></b></summary>
 
```excel
=LOWER([@[Name of Municipality(City)]])
```
Where:
  - `LOWER` is the function name that will return whatever value selected in lowercase.
  - `Name of Municipality(City)` refers to the column containing the city names
</details>

---

### Step 3: Remove Accents from City Names

My final step was to make sure that all of the cities did not contain accents due to most entries in the original dataset also not containing them.
  - I first copied all the cells in my **"Lowercase City"** column into another column entitled **"Unaccented City"**. Then I pulled that column into Power Query.
  - Once in Power Query I added the following step in advanced edit so that the m code looked like the following:

 <details>
 <summary>üìÇ<b><i>M Code to remove Accents from City Names</i></b></summary>
  
 ```m
/*
  This long line of code basically just replaces all accents with their unaccented counterparts one by one
  while also ensuring any uppercase variants become lowercase as well.
*/

let
  #"Remove Accents" = Table.TransformColumns(
  #"Changed Type",
    {{"Unaccented City", each 
       Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(
       Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(
       Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(
       Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(
       Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Replace(Text.Lower(_), "√°", "a"), "√†", "a"), 
       "√¢", "a"), "√§", "a"), "√£", "a"), "√•", "a"), 
       "√©", "e"), "√®", "e"), "√™", "e"), "√´", "e"),
       "√≠", "i"), "√¨", "i"), "√Æ", "i"), "√Ø", "i"), 
       "√≥", "o"), "√≤", "o"), "√¥", "o"), "√∂", "o"), "√µ", "o"), 
       "√∫", "u"), "√π", "u"), "√ª", "u"), "√º", "u"), 
       "√±", "n"), "√ß", "c")}}
  )
 in
  #"Remove Accents"
```

</details>

### Step 4: Remove Duplicate Cities

After cleaning the city names and converting the states into State Codes, I needed to account for any potential duplicated cities. The original dataset was more granular and included detailed disricts and administrative divisions per city. I was able to accomplish this task by highlighting my list of cities and using the `Remove Duplicates` function in Excel. 

- This gave me a cleaned table and so I copied the "StateCode" and "Unaccented City" columns to a final sheet entitled *"IBGE Brazil City States"*. This table I saved as a .csv `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth`, which I imported into Google BigQuery under the same name.
---

## Part 3. Geolocation_Final Creation

### Objective

After creating the table in BigQuery, I needed to filter the `Geolocation` table to only display cities and states that were marked as valid by my `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` table. In order to do so, I needed to complete the following steps.
 
 **1.** I needed to make sure that none of the cities in the original `Geolocation` table contained accents due to data entry errors.
 
 **2.** Join that unaccented `Geolocation` table with `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth`.

### Step 1: Creating `Geolocation_Unaccented`
- I wrote the following query in order to create a new table of geolocations that ensured all cities were unaccented:

 <details>
   <summary>üìÇ<b><i>Query to remove all accents from original Geolocation table</i></b></summary>

```sql
   /*
    This query creates a new table called Gelocation_Unaccented where all the cities from the original table are unaccented.
    LOWER(...) converts all the city names to lowercase for consistent comparison. REGEXP_REPLACE(...) replaces all the accented characters with their unaccented versions.
    The original geolocation_city column is retained as well for reference.
    */
     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Unaccented` AS
    SELECT
    geolocation_state,
    LOWER(
        REGEXP_REPLACE(
                    REGEXP_REPLACE(
                        REGEXP_REPLACE(
                            REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                    REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                        REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                            REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                                REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                                    REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                                        REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                                            REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                                                REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                                                    REGEXP_REPLACE(
                                                                        geolocation_city,
                                                                        r"[√Å√Ä√Ç√Ñ√É]", "A"),
                                                                    r"[√°√†√¢√§√£]", "a"),
                                                                r"[√â√à√ä√ã]", "E"),
                                                            r"[√©√®√™√´]", "e"),
                                                        r"[√ç√å√é√è]", "I"),
                                                    r"[√≠√¨√Æ√Ø]", "i"),
                                                r"[√ì√í√î√ñ√ï]", "O"),
                                            r"[√≥√≤√¥√∂√µ]", "o"),
                                        r"[√ö√ô√õ√ú]", "U"),
                                    r"[√∫√π√ª√º]", "u"),
                                r"√ë", "N"),
                            r"√±", "n"),
                        r"√á", "C"),
                    r"√ß", "c")
            )
     AS geolocation_city_unaccented,
    geolocation_city AS original_geolocation_city  -- Retain the original column for reference
    FROM
    `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation`
```
 </details>

### Step 2: Creating `Geolocation_Final` with a RIGHT JOIN

- Once `Geolocation_Unaccented` was created, I proceed to create the `Geolocation_Final` table using a `RIGHT JOIN` to ensure all city-state combinations from `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` were included, even if they did not have a match in `Geolocation_Unaccented`.

 <details>
 <summary>üìÇ<b><i>Query to Create Geolocation_Final</b></i></summary>

```sql
    /* 
    1.The COALESCE function is used to select values from Geolocation_Unaccented if it's present or default to values from IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth.
    This approach helps to fill in missing entries from the Geolocation_Unaccented table with data from the source of truth table.
    2. The RIGHT JOIN is used to include all rows from the IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth table, even when there aren't matches in Geolocation_Unaccented.
    */ 
    -- Create a comprehensive Geolocations_Final table using RIGHT JOIN to ensure all IBGE entries appear
     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Final AS
     SELECT DISTINCT
         COALESCE(geo.geolocation_city_unaccented, truth.city) AS city,
         COALESCE(geo.geolocation_state, truth.StateCode) AS state
     FROM     
         iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Unaccented AS geo
     RIGHT JOIN  
         iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth AS truth
     ON 
         truth.city = geo.geolocation_city_unaccented AND truth.StateCode = geo.geolocation_state;
```

### **3A. Why RIGHT JOIN?**
I noticed that when using an `INNER JOIN` to create the final table and selecting `DISTINCT` cities that were unaccented, I would get less customer_ids than if I used a `RIGHT JOIN` from the `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` table. Specifically from **(98,715)** to **(98,709)**, a loss of **6** IDs. 

**1.** **Using `Geolocation_Comparison` to Identify Missing Matches**
 - To identify the cause of these removed IDs, I created a `Geolocation_Comparison` table using a `RIGHT JOIN` and retained accents to control for any potential changes introduced by removing them. The purpose of the `RIGHT JOIN` was to ensure that all city-state combinations from the source of truth table would appear, regardless of whether there was a matching entry in the Geolocation table.

 <details>
  <summary>üìÇ<b><i>Query to Create Geolocation_Comparison</i></b></summary>
  
```sql
      CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Comparison AS 
      SELECT DISTINCT
        truth.City AS City,
        truth.StateCode AS Statecode
      FROM 
        `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation` AS geo
      RIGHT JOIN 
        `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` AS truth
      ON
        geo.geolocation_city = truth.city AND geo.geolocation_state = truth.StateCode
```  
 </details>


**2.** **Direct Comparison with Geolocation_Final** 
 - This table (`Geolocation_Comparison`) was used to directly compare with a filtered version, specifically `Geolocation_Final_Original`. The `INNER JOIN` in `Geolocations_Final` pulls only cities and states that have a match between the two tables. Additionally, accents were not removed to confirm that any discrepancies were due solely to the difference between an `INNER JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN`, rather than any potential issues introduced by `Geolocation_Unccented`.  

 <details>
  <summary>üìÇ<b><i>Query to Create Geolocation_Final_Original</i></b></summary>
  
```sql
       CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Final_Original AS 
       SELECT DISTINCT
         truth.City AS City,
         truth.StateCode AS Statecode
       FROM 
         `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation` AS geo
       INNER JOIN 
         `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` AS truth
       ON
         geo.geolocation_city = truth.city AND geo.geolocation_state = truth.StateCode
```  
 </details>



With these two versions of Geolocation tables, I could compare my customer tables to investigate why `INNER JOIN` was leading to fewer IDs. [Click here to read the steps taken in the `Customers_Final` folder](../Customers_Final/steps.md#3-comparison-of-customer-tables)

 
 - *After running my comparison, I discovered that six cities in `Customer` were either misspelled or missing entirely from `Geolocation`. Using an INNER JOIN would only include cities present in both `Geolocation` and `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth`. Therefore, to ensure these six cities were included, a `RIGHT JOIN` on `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` was the best choice, as it retains all entries from that table, regardless of their presence in `Geolocation`.*


### **3B. Why COALESCE?**
 - The purpose of the `COALESCE` function is to select values from `Geolocation_Unaccented` when present, or to default to values from `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` when they are missing. This approach handles cases like `"Sambaiba, MA"` by filling gaps in `Geolocation_Unaccented` with the authoritative data from the IBGE table.
