<h2>Geolocation Data Cleaning Process: Challenges and Limitations</h2>

<h3>Project Context</h3>
<p
  >This project required preparing geolocation data for analysis at the state
  and city levels, with an emphasis on clean and accurate geographic insights.
  To achieve this, I implemented multiple steps to normalize, verify, and
  enhance data quality, focusing especially on city-state pairings. Initially, I
  attempted to validate the entire dataset through the GeoNames API, but
  limitations in the API led me to adapt the analysis by focusing on Brazil’s
  four largest states.</p

<h3>Initial Cleaning and Normalization Efforts</h3>

<ul>
  <li
    ><strong>Identification and Correction of Inconsistencies</strong>:
    Addressed duplicate zip codes and corrected cities incorrectly mapped to
    state codes.</li
  >
  <li
    ><strong>Normalization</strong>: Standardized state entries and city names
    by trimming spaces and converting text to lowercase for consistent
    formatting.</li
  >
  <li
    ><strong>Accent Removal and Term Cleanup</strong>: Removed accents and
    unnecessary terms (e.g., "municipality") from city names to create uniform
    entries across the dataset.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Initial Attempts with GeoNames API and Limitations Encountered</h3>

<ul>
  <li
    ><strong>GeoNames API Integration</strong>: Integrated the GeoNames API to
    build a reference list of valid city-state combinations in Brazil, intending
    to use it as a benchmark for validating data quality.</li
  >
  <li
    ><strong>Limitations Encountered</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li
        >Due to record limits and incomplete city data, the API provided fewer
        valid matches than anticipated.</li
      >
      <li
        >Attempts to expand data retrieval through pagination were constrained
        by the API’s limitations, resulting in only partial validation of
        city-state combinations.</li
      >
      <li
        >With these limitations, the API verification process could not cover
        the entire dataset, leaving many city-state combinations
        unverifiable.</li
      >
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Adjusted Analysis to Focus on Four Largest States</h3>

<p
  >To improve data quality within API constraints, I adapted my analysis to
  concentrate on Brazil’s four most populous states, making data validation more
  manageable and enhancing overall data reliability.</p
>

<ol>
  <li
    ><strong>International Census Bureau Data</strong>: Acquired subpopulation
    data from the International Census Bureau for Brazil’s states, focusing on
    averages from 2016-2018 to determine the largest states:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>São Paulo</strong>: Average Population of 56,879,799</li>
      <li><strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong>: Average Population of 24,175,260</li>
      <li><strong>Minas Gerais</strong>: Average Population of 21,120,398</li>
      <li><strong>Bahia</strong>: Average Population of 15,011,824</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li
    ><strong>Targeted GeoNames API Calls</strong>: Limited the API call to
    retrieve city-state combinations for only these four states, yielding a more
    focused and accurate dataset.</li
  >
</ol>

<hr />

<h3>Final Verification and Cleaning Through GeoNames API</h3>

<ul>
  <li
    ><strong>City Cleaning for Standardization</strong>: Transformed city names
    to lowercase and removed accents to align with my dataset, creating a
    standardized reference list.</li
  >
  <li
    ><strong>Merge with Customer and Seller Data</strong>: Integrated this
    cleaned city-state data with my Customer and Seller tables, resulting in a
    significant increase in valid city-state combinations—from an initial 8 to
    approximately 150.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Final Decision and Adaptation</h3>

<ul>
  <li
    ><strong>Acknowledging Limitations</strong>: Despite this focused approach,
    some inconsistencies may remain due to the API’s inherent limitations and
    the challenges of an individual project.</li
  >
  <li
    ><strong>Summary of Limitations</strong>: Complete data accuracy was not
    feasible with the available tools. All validation and cleaning steps are
    documented to provide transparency regarding any remaining data
    limitations.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p
  >This iterative data cleaning process highlights the importance of
  adaptability in achieving data quality. By adjusting the analysis to focus on
  the largest states and merging validated city-state pairs, I improved the
  dataset’s accuracy within resource constraints. The final analysis
  transparently acknowledges these limitations, presenting insights with a clear
  understanding of the data quality considerations.</p
