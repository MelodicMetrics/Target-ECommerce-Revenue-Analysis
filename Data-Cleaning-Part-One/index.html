<h1>Data Cleaning Part One</h1>
<p
  >Welcome to the Data Cleaning Part One section. Here are the available

</ul>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The data cleaning for this project was done in two main stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li
    >The first stage focused on removing columns and attempting to use an API to
    validate city-state locations in the dataset.</li
  >
  <li
    >The second stage involved identifying missing
    <code>order_ids</code> between <code>Orders</code> and
    <code>Order_Items</code>, as well as resolving discrepancies between
    <code>total_payment_value</code> and the calculated revenue (<code
      >price</code
    >
    + <code>freight</code> from <code>Order_Items</code>).</li
  >
</ol>

<p>
  These findings served as the foundation for my second round of cleaning in
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Data-Cleaning-Part-Two/index"
    >Data Cleaning Part Two</a
  >. However, the steps detailed here are superseded by later stages of
  cleaning, and they are not necessary for reproducing the final analysis.
