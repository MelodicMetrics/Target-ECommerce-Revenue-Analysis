<h1>Challenges in Round One Cleaning of Orders, Order Items, and Payments</h1>

<h3>Overview:</h3>

<p
  >In the first round of cleaning, I discovered a few issues between the tables
  <code>Orders</code> <code>Order_Items</code> and <code>Payments</code>. Namely
  there were missing <code>order_ids</code> between <code>Orders</code> and
  <code>Order_Items</code> as well as discrepancies in order value between
  <code>Payments</code> and <code>Order_Items</code>. The following documents
  display the steps taken to identify and remove these ids. However, I
  eventually recalculated these <code>order_ids</code> in my second round of
  cleaning. These steps are here to just display the importance of iterative
  data cleaning.
