<h2>Steps to Clean Discrepancies Between Orders and Order Items Tables</h2>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
<p
  >To resolve discrepancies between the <code>Orders</code> and
  <code>Order Items</code> tables, particularly focusing on missing
  <code>order_ids</code> and ensuring accurate revenue calculations.</p
>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p
  >This document summarizes the steps taken to identify and resolve
  discrepancies in the <code>Orders</code> and <code>Order Items</code> tables,
  where missing <code>order_ids</code> impacted revenue measures. After noticing
  inconsistencies in revenue calculations, I identified 775 missing
  <code>order_ids</code> in the <code>Order Items</code> table. Some of these
  were due to orders with <strong>"canceled"</strong> or
  <strong>"unavailable"</strong> statuses, which were handled by creating
  separate tables and merging them into a final summary table. After excluding
  these missing <code>order_ids</code> from the revenue calculations, the
  measures for total revenue and revenue by category matched accurately.</p

<h3>Geolocation Table Cleaning Review:</h3>
<ul>
  <li
    >Focused on the four most populated states, resulting in
    <strong>150 cities</strong>.</li
  >
  <li
    >Acknowledged that this yield may not fully represent the overall geography
    due to constraints of a free GeoNames membership and data entry errors.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Total Revenue Calculation:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Created a measure for <strong>Total Revenue of All Orders</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Revenue by Product Categories:</h3>
<ul>
  <li
    >Developed a measure to calculate total revenue while applying filter logic
    specifically for product categories.</li
  >
  <li
    >Discovered that the total revenue by category was lower than the overall
    total revenue of all orders.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Identifying Order ID Discrepancies:</h3>
<ul>
  <li
    >Investigated discrepancies between the unique and distinct
    <code>order_ids</code> in the <code>Orders</code> and
    <code>Order Items</code> tables.</li
  >
  <li
    >Found that the <code>Orders</code> table had more unique and distinct
    entries than the <code>Order Items</code> table.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Missing Order IDs Analysis:</h3>
<ul>
  <li
    >Created a table to identify all <code>order_ids</code> not present in the
    <code>Order Items</code> table, resulting in
    <strong>775 missing IDs</strong>.</li
  >
  <li
    >Identified certain <code>order_ids</code> with statuses
    <strong>"canceled"</strong> and <strong>"unavailable"</strong> that were not
    present in the <code>Order Items</code> table.</li
  >
  <li
    >Analyzed missing IDs and found that <strong>767 rows</strong> were missing
    entries with <strong>"canceled"</strong> or
    <strong>"unavailable"</strong> statuses, leaving
    <strong>8 <code>order_ids</code></strong> unaccounted for.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Finalizing the Missing Order IDs:</h3>
<ul>
  <li
    >Created a function to display all <code>order_ids</code> with statuses that
    were neither <strong>"Canceled"</strong> nor
    <strong>"Unavailable"</strong>.</li
  >
  <li
    >Related the <strong><code>Orders with Unknown Status</code></strong> table
    to the <code>Orders</code> table on <code>order_id</code>, resulting in a
    new table that included the <code>order_ids</code> and their statuses.</li
  >
  <li
    >Merged the <strong><code>Canceled Orders</code></strong
    >, <strong><code>Unavailable Orders</code></strong
    >, and <strong><code>Orders with Unknown Status</code></strong> into one
    comprehensive table containing all
    <strong>755 missing <code>order_ids</code></strong
    >.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Adjusting the Total Revenue Measure:</h3>
<ul>
  <li
    >Edited the <strong>Total Revenue for All Orders</strong> measure to exclude
    the <code>order_ids</code> from the
    <strong><code>Compiled Order Status Summary</code></strong> table.</li
  >
  <li
    >This adjustment resulted in a total revenue figure that now matched across
    both the "by category" and "overall orders" measures.</li
  >
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Additional Considerations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li
    >Emphasized the importance of maintaining data quality by ensuring all
    relevant <code>order_ids</code> were accounted for and accurately reflected
    in the analyses.</li
  >
  <li
    >Suggested future improvements to develop a more robust methodology for
    addressing data entry errors and enhancing data validation processes.</li
  >
</ul>
