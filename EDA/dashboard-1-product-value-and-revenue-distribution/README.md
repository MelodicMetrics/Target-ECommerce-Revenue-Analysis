# Revenue Distribution Dashboard: Product Value Bins Analysis

## Purpose
This dashboard analyzes the distribution of **product revenue by value bins**, focusing on understanding how different product price ranges contribute to overall revenue and order count. It aims to provide insights into the disproportionate impact of high-value products and uncover the revenue patterns across different product categories. This analysis is critical for identifying high-value categories and prioritizing strategies for revenue optimization.

## Methodology
1. **Data Segmentation**:
   - Orders were grouped into five value bins based on their total value (`price + freight_value`): `$7.28–$100`, `$100–$250`, `$250–$500`, `$500–$700`, and `$700+`.

2. **Revenue and Order Count Calculation**:
   - Each bin's revenue contribution and order count percentage were calculated relative to the total dataset.

3. **Drillthrough Analysis**:
   - Product categories were analyzed within each value bin to uncover:
     - Total revenue per category.
     - Order count and frequency.
     - Average revenue per order.
   - The focus was on identifying categories with the highest average revenue or disproportionate contributions to specific bins.

4. **Comparative Metrics**:
   - Key metrics such as **total revenue**, **average revenue per order**, and **percentage contributions** were evaluated to highlight patterns and outliers.

## Dashboard Features
- **Main View (All Value Bins)**:
  - A combination of **bar and line charts** is used to compare the **percentage of products per value range** (bar) against the **percentage of revenue** (line). This highlights discrepancies between the number of orders and the revenue they contribute, making it easy to identify disproportionate impacts of high-value ranges.

- **Breakaway Visual (700+ Value Bin)**:
  - A **stacked bar chart** is used to display the **percentage of revenue contribution by category** within the `$700+` bin. This allows a detailed breakdown of how specific categories like *Gift Watches* and *Personal Computers* contribute to the total revenue in this high-value range.

- **Interactive Filters**: 
  - Users can filter data by year (2016–2018) and specific value bins to explore trends over time.
  
- **Detailed Tables**:
  - Breakdowns of revenue and order counts by product category and value bin.
  - Individual product details for each bin range, including total revenue and frequency.
