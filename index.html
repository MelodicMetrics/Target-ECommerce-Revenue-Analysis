<h1>Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find detailed documentation of the
  analysis steps I've taken throughout this project.

<h2>Important Note</h2>

<p>
  Please note that this project is a <strong>work in progress (W.I.P.)</strong>. 
  As such, some sections may not be fully completed and are subject to change. 
  Your feedback and patience are greatly appreciated!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Current Status:</strong> The analysis is complete, and all pages are functional. However, there are a few lingering issues under review:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Standardization Section:</strong> This section is currently broken. I am re-adding the initial steps from Google BigQuery, specifically where I detail the columns that were initially removed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>DAX Measures:</strong> DAX measures are present in both the EDA and RA sections of the webpage. I plan to consolidate them into one page with links from the EDA, RA, and Insights sections. Some links to the DAX Measures page are currently broken. While others do work, please expect occasional navigation errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pbix Files:</strong> I am working on adding downloadable .pbix files for individual dashboards in the EDA and RA sections. These files will allow users to interact directly with the dashboards, enhancing their understanding of toggles, slicers, and filters beyond static text and images.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Next Steps:</strong> Once these issues are resolved, I will update this section to reflect the changes.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<div class="hr-wrapper">
  <hr class="title" />
</div>

<h3>Objective </h3>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to explore revenue trends in e-commerce sales data
  from Target in Brazil.
</p>

<h3>Guiding Questions </h3>
<p> There are three questions guiding my analysis: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Which product categories contribute the most to overall revenue, and which
      are the most revenue-efficient based on sales volume or order count?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      How does the average order value and profitability vary by standardized
      product category and seller over time?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      How does average sales revenue vary across states, and are there any
      notable regional patterns or correlations?
    </strong>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Dataset Information </h3>
<p>
  The dataset was pulled from Kaggle and includes a time range from 2016-2018.
  There are seven related tables in the dataset with key attributes, including
  the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> customer_id </strong>: ID of the consumer who made the purchase
  </li>
  <li> <strong> customer_unique_id </strong>: Unique ID of the consumer </li>
  <li>
    <strong> order_id </strong>: A unique ID of an order made by the consumers
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> order_item_id </strong>: A unique ID given to each item ordered in
    the order
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> product_id </strong>: A unique ID given to each product available
    on the site
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> seller_id </strong>: Unique ID of the seller registered in Target
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> Data Preparation and Analysis</h2>

<div class="hr-wrapper">
  <hr class="title" />
</div>

<h3> Data Cleaning </h3>

<p>
  To ensure accuracy and consistency, detailed cleaning processes were conducted
  for each dataset. These processes are documented in two separate folders to
  reflect the iterative nature of the cleaning efforts:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      <a href="./Data-Cleaning-Part-One">Data Cleaning (Part One)</a> </strong
    >: This folder documents the initial cleaning steps taken to prepare the
    dataset for analysis. While this stage identified and addressed many key
    issues, it also revealed additional complexities in the dataset during
    subsequent analysis. The insights and challenges from this stage informed
    the next round of cleaning.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      <a href="./Data-Cleaning-Part-Two">Data Cleaning (Part Two)</a> </strong
    >: This folder builds on the foundation of Part One and documents the
    extensive iterative cleaning required to address the newly identified
    issues. With the inclusion of more cities and states, all prior steps had to
    be revisited and updated to reflect the expanded scope and refined accuracy
    of the dataset.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  While the first folder provides valuable context for the iterative cleaning
  process, the second folder contains the finalized, comprehensive cleaning
  steps that formed the basis for the final analysis and, as such, is the only
  folder useful in reproducing my analysis.
</p>

<h2>Standardization</h2>

<p>
  <em>Note: This section is a work in progress and will be updated soon. Some steps and details are currently under review.</em>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> Folder: </strong> <code> data-preparation/standardization </code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Objective: </strong> Standardize column names and data formats for
    consistent querying
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Steps: </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Renamed columns to follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., changed
        <code> product category </code> to <code> product_category </code>) for
        easier querying and readability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Removed filters for validated city-state combinations in the
        <code> Sellers </code> table to include all sellers with orders from
        customers in the target states, regardless of the sellerâ€™s own location.
      </li>
      <li>
        Documented mappings and name changes for reference (to be added).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </h2>

<p>
  In my EDA, I examined product performance by analyzing distributions across
  various value ranges, regional levels, and seller levels. These insights were
  valuable for my Revenue analysis. Below is the landing page for my EDA:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> <a href="./EDA" title="View insights on Exploratory Data Analysis"> Visit EDA Overview </a> </strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Revenue Analysis </h3>

<p>
  My revenue analysis sought to answer the three guiding questions for this project. There are three dashboards each focused on giving insights to one question. Below is the landing page for 
  the revenue analysis:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong> <a href="./Revenue-Analysis" title="View insights on revenue analysis"> Visit Revenue Analysis Overview </a> </strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p> This will bring you to a page containing all of my insights and recommendations framed within my three guiding questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> <a href="./Insights" title="View all my insights"> Visit Insights </a> </strong>
  </li>
</ul>
