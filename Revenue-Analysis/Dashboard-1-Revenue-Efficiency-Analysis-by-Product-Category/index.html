<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
  This dashboard provides a detailed analysis of revenue efficiency across
  product categories, focusing on trends, profitability proxies, and actionable
  insights to enhance performance.
</p>

<hr class="title" />

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Health & Beauty is the top-earning category with a revenue of $1.3 million,
    but Personal Computers is the most efficient category with a Revenue
    Efficiency (RE) value of $1,144.05. Three categories exceed triple the
    average RE: Household Pastels, Oven & Caf√© ($640.25), and Electrical
    Products ($514.01).
  </li>
  <li>
    Categories with smaller product lines and seller counts, like Personal
    Computers (30 products, 9 sellers), demonstrate high RE. Prioritizing these
    categories could lead to quicker revenue increases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gift Watches and Office Furniture, among the top 15 revenue categories, have
    standout RE values ($219.42 and $202.30, respectively). Office Furniture, in
    particular, has growth potential due to its relatively small product line
    (301 products).
  </li>
</ol>
