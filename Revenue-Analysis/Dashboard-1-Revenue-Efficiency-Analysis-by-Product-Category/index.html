<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Health & Beauty remains the top-earning category, but Personal Computers is
    the most efficient category with a Revenue Efficiency (RE) value of
    $1,144.05. Household Pastels, Oven & Café (RE: $630.25), and Electrical
    Products ($514.01) exceed triple the average RE.
  </li>
  <li>
    Categories like Personal Computers (30 products, 9 sellers) and Office
    Furniture demonstrate high efficiency despite smaller product lines,
    highlighting growth potential.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gift Watches (RE: $219.00) and Office Furniture (RE: $202.01) remain
    standout categories in RE. Office Furniture, in particular, shows growth
    potential with a relatively small product line (301 products).
  </li>
  <li>
    A relative difference (%) column reveals multi-item order likelihood. On
    average, the difference is <b>12.14%</b>, indicating limited multi-item
    ordering. Notably, Telecommunications (<b>24.90%</b>) and Signaling & Safety
    Products (<b>26.55%</b>) double the average, suggesting higher multi-item
    purchases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Year-over-year (YoY) growth analysis shows an overall revenue growth of
    <b>20.81%</b> between 2017 and 2018. Categories like Household Pastels,
    Oven, & Café had the highest growth (<b>4,723.90%</b>) due to product line
