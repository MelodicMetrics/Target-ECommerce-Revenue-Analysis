# Steps for Creating `Customers_Final` Table
## Overview
`Geolocation_Final_Original` was created using an `INNER JOIN` between `Geolocation` and `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth`, which resulted in **6 fewer `customer_id`s** compared to `Geolocation_Comparison`, which was made using a `RIGHT JOIN` on the same tables. To identify which IDs were missing and understand why, I created `Customers_Comparison` and `Customers_Final_Original` tables, then pulled the `customer_id`s that were absent from `Customers_Final_Original`.

After diagnosing the issue, I created `Geolocation_Final` and `Customers_Final`, which successfully included the six missing IDs.


## 1. `Customers_Comparison` Table
 - This table was made based on an `INNER JOIN` between the original Customers table and my `Geolocation_Comparison` table. This ensured the only filters on this table were based on the `RIGHT JOIN` from the Geolocation_Comparison table.

      CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers_Comparison AS 
      SELECT
         customer.customer_id AS customer_id,
         truth.City AS City,
         truth.StateCode AS Statecode
      FROM 
         `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers AS customer
      INNER JOIN 
         `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Comparison` AS truth
      ON
         customer.customer_city = truth.City AND customer.customer_state = truth.StateCode
```
</details>

## 2. `Customers_Final_Original` Table 

 - This table was based on `Geolocations_Final_Original` and `Customers`. To recap, `Geolocation_Final_Original` was created with an `INNER JOIN` rather than a `RIGHT JOIN`.
 - *Note*: The purpose of the `"..._Final_Original"` in the geolocation and customers table is to display the logic that lead to the actual Final tables. The Original final table for customers contained 98,709 entries. After making the changes the new `Customers_Final` table will contain the intended 98,715 entries.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers_Final AS 
SELECT
  customer.customer_id AS customer_id,
  truth.City AS City,
  truth.StateCode AS Statecode
FROM 
  iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers AS customer
INNER JOIN 
  `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Final_Original` AS truth
ON
  customer.customer_city = truth.City AND customer.customer_state = truth.StateCode
```
</details>
    
 ## 3. Comparison of Customer Tables 
  - Finally I wrote a Query to compare the 2 tables to identify the `customer_id`s appearing in `Customers_Comparison` but *not* in `Customers_Final_Original`.
<details>
<summary> ðŸ“‚<b><i>Expand to view the query</i></b> </summary>

```sql
-- Compares Customers_Comparison (98,715) to the final table (98,709)
SELECT
  customer_id
FROM
  iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers_Comparison
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT
  customer_id
FROM
  iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers_Final_Original
```
  
  - This query identified the 6 `customer_id`s missing due to the `INNER JOIN` between `Geolocation` and `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth`.
---
</details>

 
 - Next, I investigated one of these IDs (`"e6add8f4805cb6a382c26548daaed9d7"`) and found that the customer was based in `Sambaiba, MA`. Checking this city in both `Geolocation` and `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth` revealed that it was missing in the former, explaining why these customers were dropped in the `INNER JOIN` but retained in the `RIGHT JOIN`.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“‚ <b><i>Here's the query's used to find the customers location, as well as if the city was in the Geolocation and IBGE tables</i></b></summary>

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
  iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers
WHERE
  customer_id = "e6add8f4805cb6a382c26548daaed9d7"

SELECT *
FROM
 iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth
WHERE
 city = "sambaiba";

SELECT *
FROM
 iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation
WHERE
 geolocation_city = "sambaiba"
```
 
 - IBGE returned a result while `Geolocation` did not, indicating that the original `Geolocation` table was missing certain cities, leading to the decision to use a `RIGHT JOIN` to include all entries from `IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth`.
</details>

## 4. `Customers_Final` Table

### Overview

With the `Geolocation_Final` table now including the cities for those six `customer_id`s, I could proceed with creating `Customers_Final`. 

<details>

```sql

/*
  This query filters the Customers_Unaccented table to include only IDs with valid city-state combinations 
  based on entries in the Geolocations_Final table.
  By using the unaccented table, we ensure that both the customers and geolocations tables contain 
  city names without accents, facilitating accurate matches.
*/


CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers_Final AS 
SELECT
  customer.customer_id AS customer_id,
  truth.City AS City,
  truth.state AS Statecode
FROM 
  iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Customers_Unaccented AS customer
INNER JOIN 
  `iconic-fountain-435918-q3.Target_Ecommerce_Sales_2016_2018.Geolocation_Final` AS truth
ON
  customer.customer_city_unaccented = truth.City AND customer.customer_state = truth.state
```
