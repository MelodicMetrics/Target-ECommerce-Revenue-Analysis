<h2> Geolocation Changes Overview </h2>

<p>
  Initially, in the first phase of my data cleaning, I used the GeoNames API to create a list of valid city-state combinations to filter the dataset. However, due to constraints of using a free account, I had to limit my analysis to just <strong> 4 states </strong> and their respective cities. This yielded me <strong> 274 </strong> rows.
</p>

<p>
  Before creating my <code> Geolocation_Final </code> table, I decided to change the source of my city-state combinations to a publication by the <strong> IBGE </strong> (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). This dataset, from 2022, contains a complete list of all municipalities and federative units in Brazil, providing a more comprehensive and current basis for filtering.
</p>

<p>
  Using the IBGE dataset allowed me to increase the number of valid city-state combinations in my dataset from <strong> 274 </strong> to <strong> 5,289 </strong> entriesâ€”an increase of <strong> 5,015 entries </strong>.
</p>

<h3> Impact </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    By filtering the city-state list in Google BigQuery, I was able to apply this filter directly across all related tables. This eliminated the need for the filter logic in my Power BI DAX queries, such as the line <code> LOOKUPVALUE(Customers[customer_state], Customers[customer_id], RELATED(Orders[customer_id])) IN {"SP", "RJ", "MG", "BA"} </code>. Previously, I had to include this line in every measure and calculated column dealing with customer IDs.
  </li>
  <li>
    By incorporating this filter in Google BigQuery, my Power BI measures and DAX queries are now cleaner and more readable, allowing for easier maintenance and improved performance.
  </li>
</ul>
