# Steps to Create `Order_Items_Final`

To ensure that only `seller_ids` attached to verified customer orders appeared in `Order_Items_Final`, I used a `JOIN` with `Orders_Final` rather than `Sellers_Final`. 

Beyond this, there werenâ€™t many additional steps required. All filter logic applied to `Orders_Final` was automatically inherited by `Order_Items_Final`, since it was created using a `JOIN` with `Orders_Final`.

### SQL Query
The following query outlines the creation process for `Order_Items_Final`:

<summary>ðŸ“‚<b><i>Query to Create Order_Items_Final</i></b></summary>
  
```sql
/*
  This query creates the Order_Items_Final table with the following considerations:
  
  1. There was no need to include additional filter logic for either missing or discrepant `order_ids`:
     - Missing `order_ids` were inherently excluded, as they were already absent from the Order_Items table.
     - Discrepant `order_ids` were also excluded automatically, since this table is created by joining on `order_id` 
       from Orders_Final, which has already filtered out discrepant orders.
  
  2. Initially, I considered joining this table with the Sellers_Final table. However, doing so 
     would have introduced `order_ids` linked to sellers, regardless of whether the orders were made 
     by customers from valid city-state combinations. 

     By joining on `order_id` instead, I ensured that only orders made by filtered customers were included. 
     While this approach may still include `seller_ids` from unverified city-state combinations, this is 
     acceptable as the analysis does not focus on seller locations.
