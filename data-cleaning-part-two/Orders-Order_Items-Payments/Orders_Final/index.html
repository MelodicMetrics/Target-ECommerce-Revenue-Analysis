<h1>Orders Changes Overview</h1>

<hr />

<p>
  As noted in the <a href="../index">Overview File</a>, I needed to recalculate
  the discrepant and missing <code>order_id</code>s.
</p>

<p>
  There were more unique <code>order_id</code>s present in
  <code>Order_Items_Final</code> than in <code>Orders_Final</code>; therefore,
  the filter to remove missing IDs needed to be applied to the
  <code>Orders_Final</code> table. After doing so, I was able to ensure that
  both <code>Orders_Final</code> and <code>Order_Items_Final</code> were clean
  and usable for consistent analysis.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, by removing the <code>order_id</code>s found to be discrepant in
  order value from <code>Orders_Final</code>, I ensured consistency between
  <code>Orders_Final</code> and <code>Payments_Final</code>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em
      >Note: There was one <code>order_id</code> that appeared in
      <code>Orders_Final</code> but not in <code>Payments_Final</code>; this is
      described in detail in the <code>Payments_final_steps.md</code>.</em
    >
  </li>
</ul>
