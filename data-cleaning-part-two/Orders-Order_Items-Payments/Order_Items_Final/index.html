title: Order Items Final Overview

<h1>Overview of Order Item Changes</h1>

<p>
  In my initial analysis, I considered using a <code>JOIN</code> with the
  <code>Sellers_Final</code> table on <code>seller_id</code>. However, since I
  was no longer filtering <code>Sellers_Final</code> by the
  <code>IBGE_City_State_Source_of_Truth</code>, this approach would have
  introduced all <code>order_ids</code> linked to those unfiltered
  <code>seller_ids</code> â€” regardless of whether the orders were made by
  customers from valid city-state combinations.
</p>

<p>
  Instead, I opted to use a <code>JOIN</code> with <code>Orders_Final</code>,
  which ensured that only <code>order_ids</code> and
  <code>seller_ids</code> associated with filtered
  <code>customer_ids</code> appeared in the
  <code>Order_Items_Final</code> table. An additional benefit of this approach
  was that I no longer needed to include filter logic for either missing or
  discrepant <code>order_ids</code>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Recalculated Missing Orders</strong>:<br />
    These <code>order_ids</code> were inherently excluded, as they were already
    absent from the <code>Order Items</code> table in the initial dataset.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Recalculated Discrepant Orders</strong>:<br />
    These <code>order_ids</code> were automatically excluded, as
    <code>Order_Items_Final</code> was created by joining on
    <code>order_id</code> from <code>Orders_Final</code>, which had already
    filtered out discrepant orders.
  </li>
</ul>
